    "## Introduction\n",
    "A **filtration** consists of a total order on the simplices $\\{\\sigma_0, \\dots ,\\sigma_{N}\\}$ of a finite simplicial complex $X$ such that $X[n] = \\{\\sigma_i \\,|\\ i \\leq n\\}$ is a subcomplex of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **d-Betti curve** of a filtration is the function \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\beta_d : \\{0,\\dots,N\\} \\to \\mathbb N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "sending $i$ to the rank of the [relative cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_homology) vector space\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H^d(X,\\,X[N-i]\\,;\\mathbb F_2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **(k,d)-Steenrod curve** of a filtration is the function \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\gamma^k_d : \\{0,\\dots,N\\} \\to \\mathbb N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "sending $i$ to the rank of the [Steenrod square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steenrod_algebra) \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Sq^k : H^d(X,\\,X[N-i]\\,;\\mathbb F_2) \\to H^{d+k}(X,\\,X[N-i]\\,;\\mathbb F_2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We now describe how to construct these invariants given any filtration $X$. Let $\\partial$ be the matrix representing the boundary map \n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_*(X;\\mathbb F_2) \\to C_{*-1}(X;\\mathbb F_2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with respect to the canonical basis defined by the filtration. Following De Silva, Morozov, and Vejdemo-Johansson [[1]](https://www.mrzv.org/publications/dualities-persistence/manuscript/) we can compute representatives of $H^d(X,\\,X[N-i]\\,;\\mathbb F_2)$ which are natural with respect to the inclusion maps $X[N-i] \\leftarrow X[N-(i+1)]$ by the following procedure: consider the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta_{p,q} = \\partial_{N-q,N-p}$$\n",
    "and obtain a factorization of the form \n",
    "$$R = \\delta V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is a reduced matrix and $V$ is an upper-triangular invertible matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **barcode** of the filtration is defined to be the collection of pairs $(b,d)$ such that \n",
    "$R_{b,d}$ is a pivot or $d = +\\infty$, the $b$-th column is zero, and no pivot of $R$ has $b$ as its row coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basis for $H^*(X,\\,X[N-i]\\,;\\mathbb F_2)$ is in bijection with the number of bars $(b,d)$ satisfying $b \\leq i < d$. The bijection takes a bar $(b,d)$ to the vector $R_d$ and a bar $(b,+\\infty)$ to the vector $V_b$. We refer to the integers $b$ and $d$ as the birth and death times of the class represented by its associated cocycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the barcode we can easily obtain the Betti curves. We now describe\n",
    "how to obtain the Steenrod curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Medina-Mardones [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05031), we can effectively construct a cocycle representative of $Sq^k([\\alpha])$ given a cocyle $\\alpha$ representing it. We refer to this as the $k$-Steenrod representative of $[\\alpha]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $R_{\\leq n}$ denote the submatrix of $R$ containing the first $n$-columns. The non-zero columns in $R_{\\leq n}$ define a basis of the image of $\\delta$ restricted to $C^*(X,\\,X[N-n]\\,;\\mathbb F_2)$. The value of the $(k,d)$-Steenrod curve on $i$ is equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{rank}(A_{\\leq i}) - \\mathrm{rank}(R_{\\leq i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A_{\\leq i}$ equals $R_{\\leq i}$ augmented by the matrix containing the column vectors of $k$-Steenrod representatives of degree $d$ classes born before or at time $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement functions computing Betti and Steenrod curves and compute these invariants for certain filtrations of finite approximations of the [real projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RP^\\infty \\supset \\cdots \\supset RP^2 \\supset RP^1 \\supset RP^0.$$\n",
