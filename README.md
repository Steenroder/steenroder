The widespread use in applied topology of the barcode of filtered cellular complexes rests on a balance between discriminatory power and computability. It has long been envision that the strength of this invariant could be increase using cohomology operations. This package computes the recently defined *Sq*<sup>*k*</sup>-barcodes which have been shown to effectively increase the discriminatory power of barcodes on real-world data.
For a complete presentation of these invariants please consult [Persistence Steenrod modules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05031) by U. Lupo, A. Medina-Mardones and G. Tauzin.
